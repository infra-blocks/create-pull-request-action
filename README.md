# create-pull-request-action

This action simply calls the GitHub API to create a pull request with the provided parameters.
It also returns the response from the API as a stringified JSON output.

If the authentication token passed is the generated GITHUB_TOKEN, it should have the
pull-requests: write permissions. It should be noted also, that the GITHUB_TOKEN used when creating
pull requests [*won't trigger the majority of workflows*.](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#using-the-github_token-in-a-workflow)
